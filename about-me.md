So versed Horace. ‘Odes unheard bofore, I, priest of Muses, to maidens and young boys sing.’ I keep these three lines of lyrics as my motto, and constantly remind myself to sing songs, unheard songs, for the young-hearted people around me.

I was born in Hangzhou, China and I am currently an undergraduate student studying [computer science](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), though I am probably far more omnivorous than an average engineering student.

I was utterly captivated by the astounding sweep and beauty of modern mathematics, right after I decided to pursue a B.Eng. in computer science after years of involvement in mathematical Olympiads. I then decided to spend more time learning mathematics. After a year of foray into serious mathematics when I indulged myself learning the fundamentals of analysis, algebra, probability, geometry and so forth, and hoping one day I could grasp a tiny fraction of the insight of abstract algebraic geometry *à la* Grothendieck, **alas**, I have now redirected myself back to the application stuff (albeit it’s still quite theoretical compared to what my friends are doing), joining Prof. Lin Qian’s research workshop in [Center for Statistical Science, Tsinghua University](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and beginning my research career in machine learning. I poured my research ardour in the theoretical analysis and alternative formulations of [decision trees](https://wanghongjian.wordpress.com/2020/01/23/presentations-on-decision-trees/). Currently I am doing a (remote) research internship on machine learning theory at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), Toronto.

Philosophy, linguistics and classics are also proudly indispensable parts of my life. *Routledge Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy* is my favourite series, my daily entertainment and enlightenment, and I am particularly intrigued by the problems presented in philosophy of science, regarding quantum physics and artificial intelligence. I’m learning Classical Latin, French, and possibly Classical Greek (I’m delaying my Greek study plan indefinitely).
